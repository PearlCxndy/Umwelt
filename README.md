# Final Project Documentation: Umwelt

## Project Description

The project aims to reflect non-human organisms sensory experiences of world, through an interactive digital installation. The project name is the term, "Umwelt" that has been mentioned in the book *An Immense World* by Ed Yong. This termtranslates to "environment" or "surroundings" but also connotes the particular perspective of a particular organism, shaped by its sensory organs capabilities and perceptual systems. Our aim was to expand the vision of non-human beings into humans' sensory world, to allow them to

## Technical Description
The project is an interactive, projection mapped, revolving cube. A digital environment of four different animals' (Bird, Dog, Octupus, Bat) visions, are reflected as a game environment (made with Unity) on each vertical face. The revolving happens manually and an autoencoder reads the rotation data and sends it into Unity and then to Touhdesigner (for projection mapping), consecutivley. 

The interaction happens as the diagram below, where the user spins the cube to explore the sensory visions of four different animals  and can enter into the scene and navigate in a  playable way.

## Proccess

**1. Ideation**</br>

When we were having a brainstorming session as a group, we thought about how dogs can smell the past existences, movements, occassions within a spacial setting. This was our starting point, in order to use the time perception as a comparsion between human and non-human beings. After this, we went into a deep and extensive phase of research where we used variety of resources such as books, articles, videos, podcasts, museums, and bird recordings lol. 

This research phase made us realize we can expand the idea of time perception into various different sensory experiences. This also gave us ideas on creating a variety of playable experiences, and we could support our design proccess with a wide range of resources.

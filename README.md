## Project Description

The project aims to reflect non-human organisms sensory experiences of world, through an interactive digital installation. The project name is the term, "Umwelt" that has been mentioned in the book *An Immense World* by Ed Yong. This termtranslates to "environment" or "surroundings" but also connotes the particular perspective of a particular organism, shaped by its sensory organs capabilities and perceptual systems.

## Technical Description
The project is an interactive, projection mapped, revolving cube. A digital environment of four different animals' visions, is reflected as a game (made in Unity) on each vertical face.

The interaction happens as the diagram below, where the user spins the cube to explore the sensory visions of four different animals (Bird, Dog, Octupus, Bat) and can enter into the scene and navigate in a  playable way.

# Final Project Documentation: Umwelt

---

## Project Description

The project aims to reflect non-human organisms sensory experiences of world, through an interactive digital installation. The project name is the term, "Umwelt" that has been mentioned in the book *An Immense World* by Ed Yong. This termtranslates to "environment" or "surroundings" but also connotes the particular perspective of a particular organism, shaped by its sensory organs capabilities and perceptual systems. This project aims to make the user to asks philosophical questions such as "How does is my perception is shaping the way I think" and ethical questions as "Is the ideal world I am imagining for myself is also ideal for another species". The project aims to help the user locate themseles (as humans) within the world, equally with all of their neighbours that they are sharing this world.

## Technical Description

The project is an interactive, projection mapped, revolving cube. A digital environment of four different animals' (Bird, Dog, Octupus, Bat) visions, are reflected as a game environment (made with Unity) on each vertical face. The revolving happens manually and an autoencoder reads the rotation data and sends it into Unity and then to Touhdesigner (for projection mapping), consecutivley. 

The interaction happens as the diagram below, where the user spins the cube to explore the sensory visions of four different animals  and can enter into the scene and navigate in a  playable way.

## Proccess

**1. Ideation**</br>

When we were having a brainstorming session as a group, we thought about how dogs can smell the past existences, movements, occassions within a spacial setting. This was our starting point, in order to use the time perception as a comparsion between human and non-human beings. 

**2. Research**</br>

After deciding on the idea of the project, we went into a deep and extensive phase of research where we used variety of resources such as books, articles, videos, podcasts, museums, and bird recordings lol. 

This research phase made us realize we can expand the idea of time perception into various different sensory experiences. This also gave us ideas on creating a variety of playable experiences, and we could support our design proccess with a wide range of resources.

**3. Technical and Visual Research**</br>
We explored some of the interactions, technologies, environments and tools that  we can implement our idea together. We brainstormed some immersive experiences such as using an [immersive domes](https://www.limelight.art/portfolio/magical-dome-the-many-faces-of-entropy), or projecting on [curved screens](https://discussions.unity.com/t/360-panorama-curved-screen/884403). Our final idea was to use a rotating cube, since this gives a clearer and more interactive shift between each animal vision (game scene). We were inspired by [this project]() we found online

We decided  to use Unity as a tool with integrated shaders that would reflect the required sensory information.
Finally we made a visual library where we collected environments, characters, shaders, and color pallettes that might be implemented into the project to have a comprehensive overall outcome.


**3.Building Each Scene**</br>

After finsihing the ideation and  research phases we moved on to buiding our own individual scenes, where each of us chose an animal and created a scene for it.

**4.Making the Digital Cube**</br>

PEARL

**5. Merging the Digital Cube with the Individual Scenes**</br>

PEARL 
**6. Modeling and Laser Cutting the Revolving Cube**</br>

**7. Projection Mapping**</br>

We firstly tried connecting Unity to Madmapper. However, because of the license isssues we couldn't use it. We decided to switch to sweet old Touchdesigner.
